- For cost-efficiency, the project has now been migrated to Render. Render offers simpler deployment and management for dynamic web applications, making it a better choice for ongoing development and maintenance.

**💡 Future Improvements**

- Build a mobile app using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform support.
- Integrate with real-time university APIs for dynamic updates.
- Migrate to a cloud-based database for scalability.

**📊 Analytics**

- I have implemented Google Analytics to monitor user activity and gain insights into how students engage with the platform.
- As of now, the app has attracted 2,000 total users, with 15,000 events and 3,400 views.
